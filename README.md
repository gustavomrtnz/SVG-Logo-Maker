## Challenges Faced
As for challenges that were ran into were the testing and passing the logic of the tests. At first the error message "> static-site@1.0.0 test > echo "error: no test specified" error: no test specified"

The solution I learned from the previous error was the need to install jest and on the package.json on the "scripts" change the text in "tests" to "jest"
